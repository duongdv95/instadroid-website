                        <strong>Instadroid is best used on a dedicated phone (no SIM) that is plugged in 24/7 and connected to WIFI</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Instagram updates and UI changes can break the app, join our community on facebook to get news on updated app releases</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Going to Google Play store settings and disabling auto app updates may help Instadroid from breaking due to IG updates</strong>

You can also manually run interactions if you use your main device but beware that phone calls can interrupt the app's automation.

This app will self-navigate to Instagram and perform the actions. Navigating away from Instagram while automation is running will stop the current activity. Check Logs for successful or failed activities. Report repeatedly failed activities to our <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/298146074618530/">FB group</a>. It is important to leave the phone by itself while automation happens.

                    Actions start with pre-navigation to get to the correct page. If it fails to navigate to the correct page in time, it will be logged. After pre-navigation, action will run with a 3 hour limit.

                        There is some trial and error in figuring how much time to leave in-between each action depending on your device.
