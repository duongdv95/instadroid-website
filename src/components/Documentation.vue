This app is best used with an extra phone that is plugged in 24/7 & connected to WiFi. You can also manually run interactions, but messages or phone calls can interrupt the automation process.

This app will self-navigate to Instagram and perform the actions. Exiting Instagram will stop the current activity. Check Logs for successful or failed activities. Report repeatedly failed activities to our <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/298146074618530/">FB group</a>. It is important to leave the phone by itself while actions are carried.
